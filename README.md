# php_component_servicelocator

## General

After taking a look to the symfony dependency injection and the zend framework 2 service manager, i want to build up my own service locator.
Of course it will be heavily influenced by both and i'm happy that i can have a look at this well designed frameworks. Especially the fact that both are dealing a lot with magic call methods is a fact i don't like. Depending on how far the journey will go, i will provide a [generator](https://github.com/propelorm/Propel/tree/master/generator "generator of propelorm") like [propelorm](https://github.com/propelorm/Propel/tree/master "propelorm") by creating files with setter and getter methods or by annotations.

If it turns out to be useful, i will slice some components into separate components.

## Thanks

Thanks to the [symfony framework](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components "symfony current components") and the [dependency component](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection/ "dependency component of symfony") and also to the [zend framework 2](http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.2/en/ "manual of zend framework 2.2") and its [service manager](http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.2/en/index.html#zend-servicemanager "service manager manual of zend framework 2.2").
