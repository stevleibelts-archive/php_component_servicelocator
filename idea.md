# Example Config:

My\Class:
    alias: foo
    isShared: false
    specification:
        constructor:
            'foo'
            'My\Other\Class'
        methodCalls:
            'setBar':
                'foo'
            'setUserAndScope':
                'My\User'
                'Basic'

# Requirements

* Config based
* Can have an alias (how can alias put in namespaces? With dots?)
* Can be shared (instance pooling) or not (new creted after each call)
* Each service has a factory, even invokeables
* One factory that is using a specification object
* Each factory gets the specification object and the servicelocator injected or just the config (scoped to the object?)
* Servicelocator has to take care of create a specification object from the config
